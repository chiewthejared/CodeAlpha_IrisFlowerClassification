**Iris Flower Classification — CodeAlpha (Task 1)**
Overview

This project classifies Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using machine learning.
The dataset comes from Scikit-learn and includes four features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Joblib

What the Project Does

- Loads and explores the Iris dataset
- Visualizes features
- Splits data into training & testing sets
- Trains two models: Logistic Regression & Random Forest
- Evaluates accuracy and shows a confusion matrix
- Saves the best model (iris_best_model.pkl)

Results
Model	Accuracy
Logistic Regression	- 93.33%
Random Forest	- 90.00%

Best model saved: iris_best_model.pkl
